Upgrade the design and theme of an existing website for MPK ‚Äî Auto Air-Conditioning Service by cloning the visual style, layout, and interaction patterns from https://automechanica.com. The new theme must apply to the existing content structure and preserve all the current functionality (pages, forms, Supabase integration), while elevating the visual presentation and UX.

üß© What to Clone from Automechanica.com:
Fullscreen hero layout with background image/video and overlaid text + CTA

Bold typography with large heading sizes, confident font weight, and high contrast

Animated content entrance: slide/fade transitions on scroll

Minimalistic color palette with a premium dark theme and vibrant highlight color

Use of icon + text feature blocks for service highlights

Modern sticky navigation with logo on the left, animated hover underline on links

Smooth scrolling, subtle parallax, and interaction animations for a refined feel

Flat card-based sections with bold titles and clean spacing

Rounded CTA buttons, with strong visual prominence and hover animation

Consistent layout spacing, large margins, and wide gutters

üîß Apply the following to the existing website:
üé® Visual Theme:
Dark background: #0F172A (slate navy tone like Automechanica)

Primary accent color: Vibrant Blue #3B82F6 (for buttons, links, icons)

White and slate text: Use #F9FAFB and #94A3B8 for high contrast

Rounded UI edges and soft shadows for a clean premium look

üìê Layout & Structure:
Apply full-width layouts with centered max-width containers (max-w-7xl mx-auto)

Use two-tone section backgrounds for visual flow (alternate dark/very dark or dark/light)

Apply consistent padding/margin (py-24 px-6 md:px-12)

All content blocks should animate in with fade-up, slide-in, or zoom-in transitions

All CTA sections must be full-width with strong visual breaks and animated call-to-actions

üß† Pages to Apply New Theme To:
Home

About

Services (overview + each individual service)

Booking

Blog

Contact

Apply Jobs

Ensure visual consistency across all pages, and enhance booking and job application forms with the new UI style (rounded inputs, glowing focus states, styled submit buttons).

üß∞ Functional Requirements (Preserve from Original Site):
All forms (Booking, Apply Jobs, Contact) must stay functional and connected to Supabase

Forms should keep react-hook-form + zod validation logic

Maintain shadcn/ui components for all inputs/buttons ‚Äî apply theme override tokens if necessary

Keep sticky header, scroll-aware animations, and mobile navigation drawer

üì∏ Images:
Replace generic placeholders with relevant Unsplash images of:

Car interiors, auto repair scenes, climate control

Mechanic hands working on vents or diagnostics

Clean, modern, and high-contrast images only

All sections must use real images ‚Äî avoid empty placeholders

üí° Additional Enhancements:
Animate section reveals using framer-motion or similar

Use Tailwind + ShadCN overrides to match Automechanica‚Äôs premium dark theme

Introduce soft glowing hover states for buttons and icons

Add loading animations for page transitions and form submissions

Final Note:
Ensure the result feels like a high-end auto tech service brand, with a refined, luxurious feel ‚Äî visually similar to Automechanica.com, but functionally aligned to MPK‚Äôs existing service offerings.
